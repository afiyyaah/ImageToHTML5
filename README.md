# imageToHTML5
One of the many demonstrations of my ability to follow image outlines of web-pages to recreate them to life(or actual webpages). 
afiyyaah/imageToHTML5_01 is the first example from my "imageToHTML5" series.
The image to be converted has also been provided in the parent directory.
Happy browsing!
